        "Multithreading involves running multiple threads within the same process. Threads share the same memory space, and the overhead for creating and managing threads is lower than for processes. However, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in some languages like Python, true parallel execution is not always achieved for CPU-bound tasks. Multithreading excels in scenarios where tasks are I/O-bound.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenarios where multithreading is preferable:\n",
        "I/O-bound tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "Tasks that spend a lot of time waiting for external resources (e.g., file reading/writing, database calls, network communication) can benefit from multithreading. Since these tasks are often waiting for input/output operations to complete, the GIL is less of an issue, and multithreading allows multiple I/O operations to run concurrently.\n",
        "Example: Web scraping, web servers handling multiple client requests, and file system operations.\n",
        "Shared data:\n",
        "\n",
        "When threads need to share and modify the same data structure or memory space, multithreading is advantageous because threads can easily access shared data without complex inter-process communication (IPC).\n",

        "Lower resource overhead:\n",
        "\n",
        "Since threads share the same memory space and resources, they require less overhead compared to creating and managing processes. If you're running a task on a machine with limited memory, multithreading might be a more efficient option.\n",
        "Example: Lightweight background tasks such as monitoring or UI responsiveness.\n",
        "Faster context switching:\n",

        "Context switching between threads is generally faster than between processes because threads share the same memory. In applications where frequent task switching is required, multithreading can be more efficient.\n",

        "\n",
        "###Multiprocessing:-\n",
        "Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes, each with its own memory space. Processes run independently of each other and can execute in true parallelism on multi-core systems, which makes it more suitable for CPU-bound tasks. The overhead is higher because each process has its own memory space, requiring more resources for communication and synchronization.\n",

Instead of creating and destroying a new process for each task, which can be resource-intensive, a pool of worker processes is created at the beginning, and tasks are distributed among these workers. This technique minimizes the overhead associated with process creation and termination while maintaining efficient execution of multiple tasks in parallel.\n",

        "Process Reuse:\n",
        "\n",
        "Once a worker process finishes executing a task, it becomes available to pick up another task from the queue. This reuse of processes helps in reducing the cost associated with creating and destroying processes repeatedly.\n",

        "The process pool can handle tasks in both synchronous and asynchronous modes. In the synchronous mode, tasks are completed in a blocking manner, where the main program waits for the result before moving on. In asynchronous mode, tasks are submitted without waiting for the results, allowing the main program to perform other operations while tasks are being processed."
